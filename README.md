This world temperature map displays July temperatures for each country from 2014 to 2024, using a color scale from bright red to dark red to represent temperatures ranging from 0 to 40°C. The map features a mouse hover interaction that highlights the country’s border and shows a tooltip with the country’s name and temperature for the selected year. Additionally, a year slider created with the d3-simple-slider library allows users to select any year from 2014 to 2024, updating the map to reflect the chosen year’s data. A color legend at the bottom helps users interpret the relationship between colors and temperature values.

#tips: To run this code, ensure that all files are in the same directory and execute the GlobalTemperature_WorldMap.html file. Since this code involves loading a CSV file, it may encounter a “cross-origin request” issue in certain browsers, such as Google Chrome. To resolve this, you can either use Mozilla Firefox to open the file or install the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code and launch the project using Live Server.
